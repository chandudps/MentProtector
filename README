* FEATURES
  Purpose of this project to create a broadcast client with following features:
  0) Record video and audio from you mobile android device
  1) Write stream to local sdcard in hi quality
  2) Transcode in runtime in to low-quality and stream it to livevideo service
  3) Automatically reconnect to service after network failure w/o interrupting
     recording(1).
SEE: TODO file.

* Why yet another project, or detailed Bamuser criticism
  I'm just an user who want a service to work accordings to my demands, As you
  can see (1) and (3) features are unique, and very important for journalist's
  activity. I've loosed too many good moments because that network crap while
  using bambuser. I've emailed my proposal to bambueser team, but whey was
  rejected, because bambuser guys are seems to lazy. Bambuser offer only RTMP
  streaming for third-party clients which is close-sorced, and there are no
  light weight implementations available. Actually i'm not happy of idea to
  spend my time for investigating all this codec/transcoding/android stuff, but
  i have to, bambuser guys are too lazy, and political activists was beaten too
  many times by russian police. So this is good motivation to getting this
  project done. So shame on you bambuser. I can do my own open source project
  without your help.
